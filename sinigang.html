        <li>8 cups water</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>6 pieces gabi, (peeled and halved depending on size)</li>
        <li>1 6-inch radish (labanos), peeled and sliced to 1/2-inch thick half-rounds</li>
        <li>2 finger chilies (siling haba)</li>
        <li>1/2 bunch long beans (sitaw), ends trimmed and cut into 3-inch lengths</li>
        <li>1 eggplant, ends trimmed and sliced to 1/2-inch thick half-rounds</li>
        <li>6 pieces okra, ends trimmed</li>
        <li>15 pieces large tamarind or 1 1/2 (1.41 ounces each) packages tamarind base powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch bok choy or pechay, ends trimmed and separated into leaves</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Rinse pork ribs and drain well.</li>
        <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.</li>
        <li>Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 8 cups.</li>
        <li>Add gabi and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.</li>
        <li>Add chili peppers and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>If using packaged tamarind base, add to the pot and stir until completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.</li>
      </ol>
